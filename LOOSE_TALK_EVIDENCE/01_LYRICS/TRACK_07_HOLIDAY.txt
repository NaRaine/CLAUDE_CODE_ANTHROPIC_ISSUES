================================================================================

A T-shirt fell upon me
A loose cloak
Surprise
I love a uniform
A holiday
For the scattered mind
A pack of cards
Fifty four floats upon the water
Different costumes along the coast
State one thing and one thing only
Frivolity
The day is long
It trips and my legs do their own thing
Hearts beat
Two mongrels share a bone
Come to think of it never have I seen
So many novels pitched over eyes
Shuttlecocks
A squeal of delight and then an aside
I do not wish to count all the times we have
Missed an opportunity
To just live life
Lie on a rock
Wait for the flip
In between a dazzling sensation
I hear a child speak
The blues are extraordinary
At least for their clarity
I wave her into the sea
With love
Nobody is listening for a while
The child eats a whole apple
How?
There's no way, I say
That we're leaving
As I wrap our hair in rough towels
Picture a banquet and dismantle it
The shrimp in their basket
With one
Long
Blink
