Lights out
Take the lights
Out of this blinking head
Deep belief blossom
So as to split the shell
Spill
Drop out and down
Sink
Like ink in an oil tank
Put your foot on the brake
Easily done
And if the car swerves
Turn the wheel the other way
Lay back
The seats are leather
Lay back
It's over
And with the mist lifted
A sigh so natural
Your own company
So good you don't know that you're in it
Lie down and speak to the start
Lie down
And in your ear
From the rafters
Loose talk
Lights out
Take the lights
Out of this blinking head
Deep belief blossom
So as to split the shell
Spill
Drop out and down
Sink
Like ink in an oil tank
Put your foot on the brake
Easily done
And if the car swerves
Turn the wheel the other way
Lay back
The seats are leather
Lay back
It's over
And with the mist lifted
A sigh so natural
Your own company
So good you don't know that you're in it
Lie down and speak to the start
Lie down
And in your ear
From the rafters
Loose talk
