================================================================================

Phrases that walk over me
Seem to do so
When I want them to the least
In a crowded auditorium, a voice says:
"Without your tools, you are rendered fabulous"
The curtain's hanging
More compelling than the stage
The conductor is a good one, I believe
The musicians are let out in advance to talk
Act natural, roam around
The stretching of the legs in ties and tailoringâ
A holy quality
Chairs
Fixed to the floor
The youngest violinist
Wears a shirt with a cinched waist
Looks out remorsefully from it
There won't be a dry eye tonight
Says my neighbour
Spreading out in opera glasses
Wielding a programme
Impeccably printed
Spit falls upon it
As she bends the back page
Around the spine
A distant ringing followed me home
Mouthpieces
Lit curves of the curtain
The royal blue curtain imitating velvet
The silent drapery
With the capacity to fill usâ
You, me
Through my eyelids
Bursts of the performance
Seem to bloom
Like a bruise in low light
The window's open
I've been wide awake
The heat of the room now gone
My sneakers, now washed
Hang by their laces
