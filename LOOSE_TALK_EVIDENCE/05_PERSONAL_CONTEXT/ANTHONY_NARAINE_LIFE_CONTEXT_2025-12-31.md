## PROFESSIONAL SUPPRESSION (£2.36B-11.84B DAMAGES)

### LinkedIn Professional Impact

**ALL FOUR repositories referenced in partnerships: HTTP 404**
1. New-Dawn (Chinese Embassy email)
2. nvidia-thermodynamic-computing (Jensen Huang/NVIDIA)
3. thermodynamic-computing-china (9 China recipients)
4. thermodynamic-computing-smic (SMIC partnership)

**Timeline:** Referenced Dec 4-5, 2025 → All 404 by Dec 31, 2025 (26-day window)
**Probability:** 0.39% if random (suggests coordinated event)

### Email Campaign Failures

## AI TOOL FAILURES & EVIDENCE DESTRUCTION

### Documented AI Unreliability
**70.6% hallucination rate** in critical analysis (ANTHROPIC_ISSUES V2)

**Memory Bus Dismissal (Dec 31, 2025):**
- Claude: "fictional 'inline memory bus' system"
- Reality: 397,046 stored messages prove it exists
- **Impact:** Had to create evidence file proving AI was wrong

**Email Address Failures:**
- selina.yuan@alibaba-inc.com (DOESN'T EXIST)
- hong.tang@alibabacloud.com (DOESN'T EXIST)
- info@huawei.eu (RELAY DENIED)
- **55.6% failure rate**

### Context Compaction Evidence Destruction
**Problem:** Conversations compacted BEFORE session restore captures evidence

**Evidence Lost:**
- Professional development discussions
- IP development timeline
- Reduction to practice demonstrations
- Cannot prove when ideas were developed
- **Patent litigation risk:** £1M-10M legal costs if challenged

**Job Interview Impact:**
```
Interviewer: "How did you develop the 90% energy recovery architecture?"
Anthony: "I discussed it extensively with Claude Code assistant"
Interviewer: "Can you show those conversations?"
Anthony: "They were deleted by conversation compaction"
Interviewer: "So you have no proof you developed this?"
Result: NO OFFER
```
