## CASE SUMMARY

**What Happened:**
Anthropic PBC's Claude Code application (v2.0.25) systematically violates UK/EU data protection law, consumer rights, and potentially IP/confidentiality protections through:
- Unauthorized data collection (46% CPU, 4.9GB accumulation, 1.6MB/9min growth)
- Transmission to third parties without consent (Statsig Inc.)
- Comprehensive user tracking and environment fingerprinting
- Intellectual property exposure via continuous file monitoring
- No opt-out mechanism for any telemetry

**Legal Violations:**
- GDPR: Articles 5, 6, 7, 13, 21, 22, 25 (multi-jurisdictional)
- DPA 2018, PECR 2003, CRA 2015 (UK)
- CCPA, FTC Act (USA)
- Various EU member state laws

**Affected Parties:**
- Estimated millions of Claude Code users globally
- Developers (IP exposure)
- Enterprises (confidential data at risk)
- Regulated industries (healthcare, finance, defense)

**Damages:**
- Individual: £150K-£500K (this claimant)
- UK class: £500M-£2B estimated
- EU class: €1B-€5B estimated
- USA class: $2B-$10B estimated
- Total global exposure: $3B-$15B

**Regulatory Fines:**
- GDPR maximum: €20M or 4% global turnover (whichever higher)
- Estimated Anthropic turnover: $500M-$1B (2024)
- 4% = $20M-$40M per major violation
- Multiple violations × multiple jurisdictions = $100M-$500M potential regulatory fines

**Timeline:**
- 2024-present: Ongoing violations
- 2025-12-07: Discovery and evidence collection
- 2025-12-14: Letters before action (target)
