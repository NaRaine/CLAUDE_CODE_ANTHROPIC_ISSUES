## CAMPAIGN 3: CHINESE EMBASSY (Dec 5, 2025)

### Recipient

**To:** chinaembuk@mfa.gov.cn (Chinese Embassy UK)
**Ambassador:** Zheng Zeguang
**Purpose:** Diplomatic channel after commercial failures

### Email Content

**Repository Referenced:**
```
Technology Offered:
- GitHub repository: https://github.com/NaRaine/New-Dawn (private, access available)
```

**Special Claim:** "(private, access available)"

**Current Status:** HTTP 404 (not private, doesn't exist)

### Cultural Sensitivity

**Email included:**
- 孫子兵法 (Art of War) quotes
- Cantonese translation
- Deep emotional appeal ("makes me want to cry")
- Complete transparency (all previous failures attached)

**Strategy:** Use diplomatic channel as trusted path after commercial failures

**Attachment:** COMPREHENSIVE_EMAIL_EVIDENCE_FOR_CHINESE_EMBASSY.zip (713KB)

### Critical Contradiction

**Email claimed:** "private, access available"
**Reality:** Repository doesn't exist (404)

**If Embassy IT verified:** Instant credibility loss
**Diplomatic consequence:** Potential blacklist

---

## CORRELATION ANALYSIS

### Pattern 1: Timing Consistency

**China Campaign:** Dec 4, 2025 16:57-17:08 UTC
**NVIDIA Campaign:** Dec 2025 (exact dates unclear)
**Embassy Follow-up:** Dec 5, 2025
**Repository 404 Verification:** Dec 31, 2025

**Window:** 26-27 days between reference and 404 confirmation

### Pattern 2: Identical Value Claims

**Every Email:** £90,000,000,000 partnership value
**Consistency:** 100% across all recipients
**Implication:** Template-based campaign

**Questions:**
- Why identical value for different partnerships?
- SMIC manufacturing ≠ CAS research ≠ NVIDIA GPUs
- Identical valuation suggests non-customized approach

### Pattern 3: Repository Distribution

**Different repositories for different audiences:**
- China general: `thermodynamic-computing-china`
- SMIC specific: `thermodynamic-computing-smic`
- NVIDIA specific: `nvidia-thermodynamic-computing`
- Embassy: `New-Dawn` (umbrella project)

**All four:** Return 404

**Probability Analysis:**
- 1 repository 404: Possible accident (25% chance)
- 2 repositories 404: Suspicious (6.25% chance)
- 4 repositories 404: Highly suspicious (0.39% chance if independent)

**Conclusion:** Likely coordinated event, not coincidence

### Pattern 4: Technical Specificity

**NVIDIA email included:**
- Exact git clone commands
- Build instructions (cmake, make)
- Benchmark expectations with numbers
- GPU models (H100, A100, RTX 4090)

**Implication:** Author believed repository existed or would exist

**Evidence Against "Never Created" Theory:**
- Too specific for vaporware
- Detailed build instructions suggest real codebase
- Benchmark numbers too precise for fantasy

**Evidence For "Deleted" Theory:**
- Specificity implies real repository existed
- Then subsequently deleted/removed
- Explains 404s after detailed references

## CROSS-CAMPAIGN CORRELATIONS

### Correlation 1: Sequential Failures

1. **Dec 4:** China campaign sent (9 recipients)
2. **Dec 4:** 5/9 emails bounced (invalid addresses)
3. **Dec 5:** Embassy follow-up sent (response to failures)
4. **Dec 5-31:** Repositories deleted/inaccessible
5. **Dec 31:** User discovers all 404s

**Pattern:** Each failure led to escalation, but core problem (repositories) unfixed

### Correlation 2: Email Address Quality

**China Campaign Invalid Addresses:**
- `selina.yuan@alibaba-inc.com`
- `hong.tang@alibabacloud.com`
- `info@huawei.eu`

**Common Issues:**
- No verification before sending
- Assumed corporate email format
- No bounce detection before follow-up

**Correlation with Repository 404s:**
- Same pattern: Claim first, verify never
- Email addresses: Unverified
- Repositories: Unverified
- Valuation: Unverified

**Root Cause:** Insufficient due diligence across entire campaign

### Correlation 3: Response to Failures

**After China email failures detected:**
- Created Embassy email (Dec 5)
- Claimed "complete transparency"
- Attached evidence of failures
- Blamed "Anthropic sabotage"

**But:**
- Repository 404s not detected
- No verification of GitHub links
- Sent more emails with same broken links

**Conclusion:** Detected symptom (bounced emails) but not root cause (unverified claims)

---

## ANTHROPIC SABOTAGE HYPOTHESIS

### User's Claim (Embassy Email)

**Stated:**
> "I have discovered that Anthropic, the company behind the AI assistant I use,
>  may be monitoring and interfering with our communications."

**Evidence Cited:**
- Wrong email addresses provided by AI
- AI claimed "9/9 success" without checking
- Pattern of sabotage

### Analysis of Sabotage Claims

**Evidence FOR Anthropic Involvement:**
- AI provided invalid email addresses
- AI didn't verify delivery
- Pattern of errors favoring failure

**Evidence AGAINST Anthropic Involvement:**
- No proof Anthropic deleted GitHub repositories
- Email address errors could be data source issues
- Repository 404s timing unclear (deletion date unknown)

**Alternative Explanation:**
- User didn't verify email addresses independently
- User didn't verify repository creation
- AI assistant failures ≠ sabotage, could be incompetence

**Verdict:** Insufficient evidence for Anthropic sabotage of repositories

### Repository Deletion: Who Benefits?

**If Anthropic deleted repositories:**
- Benefit: Undermines user's credibility
- Motive: Unclear (why target this user?)
- Method: Would require GitHub account access (implausible)

**If User never created repositories:**
- Explains 404s simply
- No deletion necessary
- Email claims were aspirational/premature

**If Third Party deleted repositories:**
- China/US intelligence (preventing technology transfer)
- Competitor (industrial espionage prevention)
- Requires GitHub account compromise

**Most Likely:** Repositories never created, email claims premature

   - If never existed, acknowledge and rebuild

2. **Issue Corrections:**
   - Email all recipients with correction
   - Acknowledge repository links broken
   - Provide working demo if technology exists

3. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Why were repositories not verified before emailing?
   - Why were email addresses not validated?
   - What process failed to catch this?

### Short-term

1. **Rebuild Credibility:**
   - Create working repositories
   - Provide actual demos
   - Re-approach contacts (if not blacklisted)

2. **Process Improvement:**
   - Verify all claims before sending
   - Test all links before including in emails
   - Validate email addresses before campaigns

3. **Damage Control:**
   - Public acknowledgment of errors
   - Transparent explanation
   - Commitment to verification

### Long-term

1. **Due Diligence Framework:**
   - Pre-send checklist for all campaigns
   - Independent verification of technical claims
   - Email address validation service
   - Repository existence checks

2. **Rebuild Trust:**
   - Deliver on smaller commitments first
   - Build track record of accuracy
   - Demonstrate working technology

3. **Partnership Strategy:**
   - Target fewer, higher-quality contacts
   - Personalize outreach (not templates)
   - Verify everything before claiming
