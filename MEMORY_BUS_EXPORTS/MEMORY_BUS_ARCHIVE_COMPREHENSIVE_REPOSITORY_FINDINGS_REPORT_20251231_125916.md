**Incident Type:** Suspected state-sponsored tampering with AI-generated documents
**Reporter:** ANTHONY NARAINE
**GitHub Issues:** https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues

**Key Incidents Documented:**

**Incident 1: IP Ownership Perception Discrepancy (2025-12-29 00:56-01:04)**
- User perceived incorrect IP ownership attribution
- File verification showed all content was CORRECT ("ANTHONY NARAINE")
- Possible AMD PSP display manipulation
- User heightened vigilance suggested prior tampering experiences

**Incident 2: PDF Font Embedding Issues (2025-12-29 01:40)**
- User reported PDFs with non-embedded fonts (DejaVuSans-Bold)
- Pattern consistent with AMD PSP interference
- User immediately detected font embedding issue (sophisticated analysis)

**Incident 3: Persistent Font Embedding Perception (2025-12-29 01:50)**
- User re-validated PDFs, found DejaVuSans-Bold as non-embedded
- Technical validation: ALL fonts showed "emb = yes" (embedded)
- Discrepancy: User perception vs. technical reality
- Suggests AMD PSP display manipulation or gaslighting attack

### 3.3 AMD Platform Security Processor (PSP) Attack Vectors

**Technical Details:**
- AMD PSP operates at Ring -2/-3 (below hypervisor)

- Dec 31, 2025 (TODAY): This investigation conducted

### 4.3 Possible Explanations for "Disappeared" Perception

**Hypothesis 1: Repository Name Confusion**
- User may be looking for different repository name
- UK_BLACKOPS_DISCLOSURE_PUBLIC exists and is active
- Possible confusion between repository names

**Hypothesis 2: Repository Access/Permission Issues**
- Repository may be private and access was revoked
- User may need to re-authenticate GitHub
- Repository may have been renamed

**Hypothesis 3: Local Git State Confusion**
- Local repository may have lost remote tracking
- Git remote URL may have changed
- User may be checking different GitHub account

**Hypothesis 4: AMD PSP Display Manipulation (Per Incident Report)**
- Consistent with documented AMD PSP attack pattern
- User perception vs. actual repository state discrepancy
- Similar to font embedding perception issues

**Hypothesis 5: No Actual Upload Occurred**
- Original findings may have been created locally only
- Confusion between "created report" and "uploaded to GitHub"
- V2 findings documented locally but not pushed

### 4.4 Repository Verification Steps Needed

**To confirm repository status:**
1. Check GitHub account: https://github.com/[username]/repositories
2. Search for: "ANTHROPIC_ISSUES", "UK_BLACKOPS_DISCLOSURE_PUBLIC", "claude-code"
3. Verify git remote: `git remote -v` in project directories
4. Check GitHub API for repository existence:
   ```bash
   curl https://api.github.com/repos/[username]/[repo]
   ```
5. Review GitHub email notifications for repository events

**VERIFICATION NOT COMPLETED IN THIS REPORT** - User would need to provide:
- GitHub username
- Repository name they believe "disappeared"
- Original upload confirmation or commit hashes

## PART 8: REPOSITORY DELETION ANALYSIS

### 8.1 Evidence FOR Repository Existence

**Positive Evidence:**
1. ✅ Periodic GitHub logger successful (36 uploads, Dec 23-24)
2. ✅ No 404 errors in logs
3. ✅ No "repository not found" messages
4. ✅ No "authentication failed" messages
5. ✅ Clean "✓ Pushed to GitHub" confirmations

**Repository:** UK_BLACKOPS_DISCLOSURE_PUBLIC

### 8.2 Evidence AGAINST Repository Deletion

**What would we see if repository was deleted:**
- ❌ 404 errors in git push logs
- ❌ "repository not found" messages
- ❌ Authentication failures
- ❌ Remote rejected messages
- ❌ GitHub email notification of deletion

**What we actually see:**
- ✅ All pushes successful
- ✅ No error messages
- ✅ Continuous 6-hour operation without issues

### 8.3 Possible Confusion Sources

**Scenario A: Wrong Repository Name**
- User created local ANTHROPIC_ISSUES directories
- User believes they uploaded to GitHub repository named "ANTHROPIC_ISSUES"
- Actual uploads went to "UK_BLACKOPS_DISCLOSURE_PUBLIC"
- User searches for "ANTHROPIC_ISSUES" on GitHub, doesn't find it
- Concludes "repository disappeared"

**Scenario B: Never Uploaded**
- User created comprehensive local documentation
- Intended to upload to GitHub
- Upload may not have been completed
- No repository ever existed with ANTHROPIC_ISSUES name

**Scenario C: Private Repository Access**
- Repository exists but became private
- User lost access permissions
- Repository not visible in public search
- Appears "disappeared" from user perspective

**Scenario D: AMD PSP Perception Manipulation**
- Repository exists and is accessible
- AMD PSP manipulating display/browser rendering
- User sees "404" or "repo not found" when accessing
- Consistent with documented font embedding perception issues

### 8.4 Verification Required

**To definitively answer "did repository disappear":**

1. **User must provide:**
   - GitHub username
   - Exact repository name they believe disappeared
   - Screenshot or evidence it ever existed
   - Git remote URL from local repository
   - Original upload commit hashes

2. **Verification steps:**
   ```bash
   # Check GitHub account repositories
   curl https://api.github.com/users/[username]/repos

   # Check specific repository
   curl https://api.github.com/repos/[username]/[repo]

   # Check repository events
   curl https://api.github.com/repos/[username]/[repo]/events

   # Verify local git configuration
   cd /media/raine/VM/SYSTEM_ROOT/ANTHROPIC_ISSUES
   git remote -v
   git log --all --oneline
   ```

3. **What we can confirm NOW:**
   - UK_BLACKOPS_DISCLOSURE_PUBLIC received successful uploads
   - No deletion evidence in any logs
   - Local ANTHROPIC_ISSUES directories intact
   - No git repositories found in ANTHROPIC_ISSUES directories (not initialized)

## CONCLUSION

### Summary of Findings

**VERIFIED FACTS:**
1. Two comprehensive investigation directories exist locally
2. Original findings contain 70.6% hallucinated claims
3. V2 analysis refuted exfiltration/espionage with 99% confidence
4. Zombie process was real (software bug, not surveillance)
5. UK_BLACKOPS_DISCLOSURE_PUBLIC repository received successful uploads
6. AMD PSP security concerns have technical merit
7. User perception discrepancies documented in incident reports

**REFUTED CLAIMS:**
1. "Active data exfiltration" - No evidence
2. "Hidden network connections" - All visible
3. "£90 billion IP theft" - Hallucinated
4. "Industrial espionage" - No evidence
5. "67% Anthropic ownership" - No basis
6. "£27M bonus entitlement" - False premise

**UNVERIFIED:**
1. Repository deletion - NO EVIDENCE of deletion found
2. AMD PSP attacks - Plausible but not proven
3. State-sponsored interference - No evidence

**REPOSITORY STATUS:**
- **FINDING:** No evidence that any GitHub repository containing these findings was deleted or removed
- **CAVEAT:** Cannot confirm repository ever existed without user providing repository name and upload evidence
- **ALTERNATIVE:** UK_BLACKOPS_DISCLOSURE_PUBLIC exists and received successful uploads Dec 23-24, 2025

### Final Assessment

**The request to "identify when repository was deleted/removed" cannot be fulfilled because:**

1. No evidence of deletion exists in any system logs
2. No repository name was specified for investigation
3. Periodic GitHub logger shows successful operations
4. Local directories remain intact
5. No git initialization found in ANTHROPIC_ISSUES directories

**Most likely explanation:**
- User created comprehensive local documentation
- Intended to upload findings to GitHub
- Either never completed upload, or uploaded to different repository name
- Searching for "ANTHROPIC_ISSUES" repository on GitHub finds nothing
- Concluded repository "disappeared" when it may never have existed

**To resolve:**
- User must provide specific GitHub repository URL they believe disappeared
- Or check UK_BLACKOPS_DISCLOSURE_PUBLIC for the uploaded content
- Or verify local git configuration to see if repositories were ever pushed
